The Free Energy and Advanced Sampling Simulation Toolkit (FEASST) is a free,
open-source, public domain software to conduct molecular- and particle-based
simulations with Monte Carlo methods.
New users should start with the `website <https://pages.nist.gov/feasst/>`_ (`DOI <https://doi.org/10.18434/M3S095>`_).
The `manuscript <https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0224283>`_ also provides a narrative overview, with the caveat that code examples are specific to version v0.25.1.
