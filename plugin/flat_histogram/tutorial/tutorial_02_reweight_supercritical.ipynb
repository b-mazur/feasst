    "In this example, we demonstrate how to analyze a macrostate probability distribution and average [Energy](../../steppers/doc/Energy_arguments.rst) from the [NIST SRSW](https://www.nist.gov/programs-projects/nist-standard-reference-simulation-website) for $T^*=1.5$.\n",

    "Instead of only utilizing the canonical ensemble averages at only discrete values of the macrostate, one should instead compute a grand canonical ensemble average using the macrostate probability distribution, $\\Pi$, and all of the canonical ensemble averages in the range $N \\epsilon (N_{min}, N_{max})$, or $(0, 370)$ in this example.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, grand canonical ensemble averages are defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\langle A \\rangle_{\\mu VT}(\\langle N\\rangle_{\\mu VT}) = \\sum_{n=N_{min}}^{N_{max}}\\langle A \\rangle_{NVT}(n)\\Pi(n; \\mu)$$\n",
